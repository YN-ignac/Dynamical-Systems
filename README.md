# Dynamical-Systems

Primarily, this repository comprises codes for the course "Methods of Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamic Models," taught by Professor M. Kubíček at UCT Prague.
The development of these codes was facilitated by Dr. M. Kohout.

## Description
This repository focuses on the study and simulation of dynamical systems using **Fortran** and **Python**. Dynamical systems are mathematical models used to describe the time-dependent evolution of a system's state. The primary goal of this project is to analyze, simulate, and visualize various types of dynamical systems, such as linear and nonlinear systems.

The majority of the repository is written in **Fortran**, with some supporting scripts in **Python** (used for visualization).

## Features
- Implementation of numerical solutions for differential equations.
- Simulation of dynamical systems models.
- Tools for analyzing the stability and behavior of systems.
- Visualization scripts for system trajectories.

## Applications
- Chaos theory
- Control systems
- Signal processing
- Population dynamics
